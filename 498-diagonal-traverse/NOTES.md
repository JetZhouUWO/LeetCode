The first row and the last column in this problem would serve as the starting point for the corresponding diagonal. Given an element inside a diagonal, say [i, j][i,j], we can either go up the diagonal by going one row up and one column ahead i.e. [i - 1, j + 1][i−1,j+1] or, we can go down the diagonal by going one row down and one column to the left i.e. [i + 1, j - 1][i+1,j−1]. Note that this applies to diagonals that go from right to left only. The math would change for the ones that go from left to right.
